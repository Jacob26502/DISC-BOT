What we need







a bot that can notify the relevant people just before they have a lecture

  grab the next lecture




to give a link if one is appropriate






to also be able to give updates on the status of the Lecture





to cancel when a lecture is



to tell someone what/when their next lecture is

  a command that grabs the next lecture and prints it




what I need:
bot needs all future lecture infos
the lecture list needs to be updated with more information (status, url, work due perhaps, extra info)

be able to give info on the lecturers and lectures
